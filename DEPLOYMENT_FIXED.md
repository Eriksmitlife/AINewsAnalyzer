# AutoNews.AI - Deployment Issue RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
Replit blocked deployment with error:
```
The run command contains 'dev' which is blocked for security reasons
Using development command 'npm run dev' instead of production command in deployment
```

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Updated Production Scripts
- Fixed ES module compatibility in `deploy.js` and `start.js`
- Added proper import statements and `__dirname` handling
- Scripts now enforce `NODE_ENV=production` and validate security requirements

### 2. Fixed Frontend Issues
- Added missing MLMProfile route in App.tsx
- Resolved component import errors causing browser crashes

### 3. Deployment Commands Ready
Since `.replit` file cannot be modified, use these production-compliant commands:

**Primary Option (Recommended):**
```bash
node deploy.js
```

**Alternative Options:**
```bash
node start.js
# OR
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

## How to Deploy

### For Replit Deployment Interface:
1. In your Replit deployment settings, change the run command from `npm run dev` to `node deploy.js`
2. Ensure `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is configured
3. Deploy through Replit's interface

### What the Scripts Do:
- **deploy.js**: Builds application automatically, validates environment, starts production server
- **start.js**: Quick start for pre-built applications with production validation
- Both scripts enforce security compliance and prevent development mode execution

## Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT ✅

The deployment scripts are working correctly and will bypass Replit's security restrictions while maintaining production compliance. Simply change your deployment run command to `node deploy.js` and deploy.

## Environment Variables Required:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV` - Automatically set to 'production' by scripts
