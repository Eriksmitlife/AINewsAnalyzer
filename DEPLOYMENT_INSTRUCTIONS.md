# AutoNews.AI Production Deployment - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION FOR REPLIT DEPLOYMENT ERROR

The deployment error occurs because Replit's security system blocks commands containing 'dev' in production deployments. The solution is already implemented - you just need to update the deployment configuration.

## STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT FIX

### Option 1: Change Deployment Command in Replit UI (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to your Replit project**
2. **Click the "Deploy" button** in the top navigation bar
3. **Navigate to the "Configuration" tab**
4. **Find the "Run Command" field** (currently shows `npm run dev`)
5. **Change the run command** from:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   to:
   ```
   node deploy.js
   ```
6. **Click "Save Configuration"**
7. **Click "Deploy"** to start the production deployment

### Option 2: Alternative Production Commands

If you need different deployment options, use any of these production-ready commands:

- `node deploy.js` (Recommended - includes automatic build)
- `node start.js` (Quick start for pre-built apps)
- `npm run start` (Uses package.json start script)

## WHAT THE SOLUTION DOES

### Security Compliance
- ✅ Removes 'dev' keyword from deployment command
- ✅ Forces production mode (`NODE_ENV=production`)
- ✅ Validates all required environment variables
- ✅ Blocks development configurations in production

### Automatic Features
- ✅ Builds application automatically if needed
- ✅ Validates production build artifacts
- ✅ Checks database connectivity
- ✅ Starts optimized production server
- ✅ Enables security headers and middleware

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REQUIRED

Ensure these are configured in your Replit deployment:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string (already configured)
- `NODE_ENV` - Automatically set to 'production' by deployment scripts

## VERIFICATION

After deployment, your app will:
1. Build automatically if needed
2. Start in production mode
3. Serve optimized frontend assets
4. Connect to PostgreSQL database
5. Enable all security features

## STATUS: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT ✅

Your project is fully configured for production deployment. Simply change the deployment run command to `node deploy.js` in the Replit deployment interface and deploy.

The deployment scripts handle all security requirements and production optimizations automatically.
