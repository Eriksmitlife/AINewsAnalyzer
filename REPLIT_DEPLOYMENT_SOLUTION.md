# AutoNews.AI - Replit Deployment Solution

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION FOR DEPLOYMENT ERROR

The deployment error occurs because Replit blocks `npm run dev` in production for security reasons. The solution is already implemented in your project.

### Step 1: Change Deployment Command
In your Replit deployment settings, change the run command from:
```
npm run dev
```
to:
```
node deploy.js
```

### Step 2: Alternative Deployment Commands
If the above doesn't work, try these alternatives:
- `node start.js` (for pre-built apps)
- `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js` (manual production start)

## Why This Works

The `deploy.js` script:
- ✅ Forces `NODE_ENV=production` (bypasses security block)
- ✅ Automatically builds the application if needed
- ✅ Validates all production requirements
- ✅ Starts the server with production optimizations
- ✅ Complies with Replit security policies

## Production Scripts Overview

### deploy.js (Recommended)
- Comprehensive deployment script
- Automatic build process
- Environment validation
- Database connectivity checks
- Production server startup

### start.js (Quick Start)
- Fast startup for pre-built applications
- Production mode validation
- Lightweight deployment option

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in your Replit deployment:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV` - Automatically enforced by scripts

## Verification Steps

1. The deployment scripts validate production environment
2. Build artifacts are checked/created automatically
3. Database connectivity is verified
4. Server starts with production optimizations

## Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT ✅

Your project is fully configured for production deployment. Simply change the deployment run command to `node deploy.js` and deploy through Replit's interface.
