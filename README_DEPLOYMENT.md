# AutoNews.AI Deployment Configuration

## Deployment Issue Resolution

The deployment failed because the .replit file is configured to use development mode (`npm run dev`) instead of production mode. Here's how to fix it:

## Quick Fix for Deployment

### Option 1: Use the Production Deployment Script
We've created a production-ready deployment script:

```bash
node deploy.js
```

This script:
- Automatically builds the application if needed
- Sets the correct environment variables
- Starts the server in production mode
- Handles graceful shutdown

### Option 2: Manual Build and Start
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start in production mode
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

## Configuration Changes Needed

Since the .replit file cannot be modified directly, you'll need to:

1. **For Replit Deployments**: Change the deployment run command from:
   ```
   run = ["sh", "-c", "npm run dev"]
   ```
   to:
   ```
   run = ["sh", "-c", "node deploy.js"]
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure these are set:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `DATABASE_URL` (should already be configured)

## Production Optimizations

The application includes:
- âœ… Production build with Vite (frontend) and esbuild (backend)
- âœ… Static asset serving in production mode
- âœ… Environment-specific configurations
- âœ… Graceful shutdown handling
- âœ… Error logging and monitoring

## Deployment Scripts Available

1. `deploy.js` - Full production deployment with build verification
2. `start.js` - Simple production starter with build check
3. `npm run start` - Direct production start (requires existing build)

## Verification

After deployment, verify the application is running correctly:
- Check the server logs for "ðŸš€ AutoNews.AI Server Started Successfully"
- Verify the environment shows "production" mode
- Test the application endpoints

## Security Notes

The production configuration includes:
- Security headers and middleware
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Compression and optimization
- Error handling without sensitive data exposure
