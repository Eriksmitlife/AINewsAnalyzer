# Deployment Configuration Fix

## The Problem
Replit's security measures are blocking deployment because the current configuration uses `npm run dev` which contains the 'dev' keyword - not allowed in production deployments.

## The Solution
Change the deployment run command from `npm run dev` to `node deploy.js`

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Method 1: Update via Replit Deployment Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to your Replit project
2. Click on the **"Deploy"** button in the top navigation
3. Navigate to the **"Configuration"** tab
4. Find the **"Run Command"** field
5. Change from: `npm run dev`
6. Change to: `node deploy.js`
7. Click **"Save Configuration"**
8. Click **"Deploy"** to start the deployment

### Method 2: Alternative Production Commands
If you need different options, you can use any of these production-ready commands:
- `node deploy.js` (Recommended - includes build verification)
- `node start.js` (Requires pre-built app)
- `npm run start` (Uses package.json start script)

## Environment Variables Required
Make sure these environment variables are configured in your Replit deployment:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV` - Will be automatically set to 'production' by the deployment scripts

## What the Fix Does

### Security Compliance
- âœ… Removes 'dev' keyword from deployment command
- âœ… Forces production mode (`NODE_ENV=production`)
- âœ… Validates all required environment variables
- âœ… Blocks development configurations in production

### Production Optimization
- âœ… Automatically builds the application if needed
- âœ… Uses production-optimized server configuration
- âœ… Enables security headers and middleware
- âœ… Implements proper error handling

### Build Process
- âœ… Frontend: Vite build with optimizations
- âœ… Backend: esbuild bundle with Node.js targeting
- âœ… Output: `dist/` directory with production assets

## Verification
After updating the deployment configuration, the deployment should succeed. The scripts will:
1. Validate production environment
2. Check for required environment variables
3. Build the application if needed
4. Start the production server

## Status
ðŸ”§ **Action Required**: Update deployment run command to `node deploy.js`
ðŸ“‹ **Ready**: All production scripts are configured and tested
âœ… **Verified**: Security compliance and production optimization implemented
